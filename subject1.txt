作成したプログラムの説明：
６行目で１～３０までの値の出現回数を記録する配列を用意している。

７～１４行目で、乱数を生成するgenerate_random_numbers関数を作成した。
これは、rand()で出てきた値の３０の剰余に１を加えることによって生まれた値を１～３０の値の乱数としている。
そして、その値に対応した配列の中身をインクリメントすることによって、乱数の個数をカウントしている。

１６～２６行目のmain関数内で、generate_random_numbers関数によって作成された配列を用いて、ヒストグラムを作成している。


2. 
乱数を生成する関数generate_random_numbers内のforループの8行目を一つ目のブレイクポイントに設定した。
また、main関数内の一つ目のforループの18行目を二つ目のブレイクポイントに設定した。そして、その様子を観察した。
